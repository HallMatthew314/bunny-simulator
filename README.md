# Bunny Simulator

This is a repository of implementations for the 'graduation' challenge specified in [this](http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/) cplusplus.com thread (about halfway down the page). I find this challenge to be a good test of your ability to use a programming language, so I am creating different versions of it in different languages.
